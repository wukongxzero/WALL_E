L298N #1 (Front-Left + Front-Right)

ENA → D5 (PWM)

IN1 → D7

IN2 → D8

ENB → D6 (PWM)

IN3 → D9

IN4 → D10

L298N #2 (Rear-Left + Rear-Right)

ENA → D3 (PWM)

IN1 → D11

IN2 → D12

ENB → D4 (PWM) (D4 isn’t PWM, so we’ll treat it as on/off for now)

If you want PWM on all 4 channels, we’ll remap later (UNO has only 6 PWM pins).

IN3 → D13

IN4 → A0 (yes, A0 can be digital pin 14)

Power rules (important)

Motor battery → L298N “12V/VIN” (or “+12V”) and GND

Arduino powered separately (USB ok)

Common ground: Arduino GND ↔ both L298N GND ↔ battery GND

Also: remove the ENA/ENB jumpers on L298N if you want PWM speed control.


Pass/Fail for Step 1A

✅ PASS if:

each channel spins forward and reverse when its test runs

motors don’t brown-out Arduino (if they do, your grounds/power are wrong)

❌ FAIL if:

Arduino resets when motors start → common ground missing / motor supply sag / using Arduino 5V

motor only spins one direction → IN1/IN2 wiring wrong or driver channel bad

nothing spins → EN jumpers still on? (or EN not powered)
